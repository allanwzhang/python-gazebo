# `env`

This directory contains python code for simulation, control, and communication of multirotor dynamics. It relies on the `multirotor` python library, which is
installed here as a submodule. Alternatively, it can be installed from pip as `pip install multirotor`.

The demo is available in [`Demo.ipynb`]('./Demo.ipynb).
